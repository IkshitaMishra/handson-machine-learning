# handson-machine-learning
Repo of Machine Learning Algorithms implemented both in Python and R. Algorithms predict and visualize results of small dataset. Algorithm uses Scikit-learn, a machine learning library for the Python programming language.
Completed a course on Udemy - 'Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science'. The course helped me alot in understanding predictions. This repo is with help of the stated course.

# Scikit-learn 
Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. The library is used in various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.

# Confusion Matrix
In the field of machine learning, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning. It gives correct count of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positive, False Negatives.

# Precision and Recall
Precision (P) is defined as the number of true positives (TP) over the number of true positives plus the number of false positives (FP).
Recall (R) is defined as the number of true positives (TP) over the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives (FP).

# k-Fold Cross Validation
Several rounds of cross validation are performed by using different cross validation training sets and cross validation testing sets. 
The results from all the rounds are averaged to estimate the accuracy of the machine learning model.

# Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple learners are trained to solve the same problem. Ensemble methods try to construct a set of hypotheses and combine them to use.

# Overfitting
The production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably.
